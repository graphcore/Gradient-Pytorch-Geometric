    "- Tox21\n",
    "- ZINC12K. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these datasets contributes different aspects, ensuring a comprehensive benchmarking tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "QM9, known in the realm of 3D GNNs, provides 19 graph-level quantum properties tied to the energy-minimized 3D conformation of molecules. Given that these molecules have at most nine heavy atoms, it's simpler and enables fast model iterations, much like the larger proposed quantum datasets, but on a smaller scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Tox21 dataset is notable among researchers in machine learning for drug discovery. It is a multi-label classification task with 12 labels, exhibiting a high degree of missing labels and imbalance towards the negative class. This mirrors the characteristics of larger datasets, specifically in terms of sparsity and imbalance, making it invaluable for learning to handle real-world, skewed datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the ZINC12K dataset is recognized in the study of GNN expressivity, an essential feature for large-scale data performance. It's included in ToyMix with the expectation that successful performance on this task will correlate well with success on larger datasets.\n",

    "## Multitask learning\n",
    "\n",

    "## Conclusions and next steps\n",
    "We have demonstrated how you can use Graphium for multitask molecular modelling on the IPU. We used the ToyMix dataset, which combines the QM9, Tox21, and ZINC 12k datasets to show how Graphium trains models to concurrently predict multiple properties with chemical awareness.\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the validation and test results we can see the impact of the larger QM9 dataset in improving the single task performance of the smaller datasets. The accuracy and MAE scores are much better than we would expect just from training on the small datasets, confirming the training benefit from a multitask setting even on a very short training run. \n",
    "To further verify this we can look at the same model trained for the full number of epochs on the multitask dataset and the individual datasets and compare the final validation results. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can try out the following:\n",
    "-  Increase the number of epochs for training to around 30. This should yield reasonably good results. If you train for 300 epochs, your results should match the benchmarking results. \n",
    "- Change the config file to use a different model. GIN will achieve higher accuracy than GCN, and GINE will have a higher accuracy than GIN. \n",
    "- Adapt the multitask config to only use a single dataset. You can use this to compare the results of the multitask performance with a single task performance. Rremember to remove the relevant sections from the dataset, the losses and the metrics. Example YAML config files showing how to do this for GCN with the QM9 (`config_small_gcn_qm9.yaml`) and ZINC 12k (`config_small_gcn_zinc.yaml`) datasets are given. \n",
