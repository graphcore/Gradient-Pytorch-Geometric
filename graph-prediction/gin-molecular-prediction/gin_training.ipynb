This can waste a lot of space in the mini-batch as we some mini-batches may contain many small samples, resulting in a large amount of padding to get the mini-batch up to fixed size. Let's try the `StreamPack` strategy which instead will pack samples into a batch up to the specified fixed-size, resulting in a varying number of samples in a mini-batch but reducing the amount of wasted space.

    "- The classification layer is used to accomplish the task of graph classification\n",

    "Where $h_{v}^{(0)}$ are the initial node attributes for each node. The above specialisation is a result of wanting to represent an injective function that operates on multisets of node attributes through the use of MLPs. If the $k$-hop representation of a node is defined by an injective function, it can be asserted that any two nodes that have the same $k$-hop representation are isomorphic due to the definition of injectivity. Further, any two graphs that have the same representation as generated by such an injective function will be isomorphic. This property is well suited for the task of graph classification as it allows graphs with different structural properties to differentiated. Some GNN architectures (e.g. [GraphSage](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02216), [GCN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.02907)) do not satisfy learning injective functions on multisets and therefore have drawbacks when used for the graph classification task.\n",
