    "# Small graph batching on IPUs using packing\n",
    "\n",
    "Batching small graphs is a crucial step to enable scaling GNNs to use large quantities of data and improve model performance.\n",
    "Small graphs have a different structure to other data types so we have to take an alternative approach to batching them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, when forming a batch from images or text, the samples are usually concatenated along a new batch axis. However, when using PyTorch Geometric for small graphs, a new axis isn't created but instead graphs are stacked side by side. This produces a dynamic shape per batch which needs to be accounted for when using IPUs. It is possible to pad a batch of these graphs to a maximum size, as seen in the Small Graph Batching tutorial, found within: `learning-pytorch-geometric-on-ipus/3_small_graph_batching_with_padding.ipynb`. However this approach can result in a lot of wasted compute on the padded parts of the batch. There are other ways to improve this inefficiency which we will consider in this tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you will learn how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- use a packing method to achieve data of fixed size in preparation for execution on the IPU,\n",
    "- use masking in a model, which will enable you to correctly calculate the loss function on the relevant subgraphs,\n",
    "- use PopTorch to transform and prepare a model for distributed training and inference on the IPU.\n",

    "## Batching small graphs using packing\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Small Graph Batching tutorial, a method to achieve fixed size mini-batches of small graphs is proposed. A limitation of this approach is that there may be a lot of compute wasted on nodes and edges used for padding, for more detail find it here: `learning-pytorch-geometric-on-ipus/3_small_graph_batching_with_padding.ipynb`.\n",
    "\n",
    "An alternative and more efficient method is to use packing. This works simply by continuing to add graphs to each mini-batch without exceeding the limits of the mini-batch set by the user: the maximum number of nodes, edges, or graphs in a mini-batch. Once one of these limits is reached then we can add null graphs which can be used to pad at the end of the mini-batch to achieve a fixed size. By doing this we are lowering the ratio of padded to packed values. This means that the more valid subgraphs will be executed on at runtime, which improves efficiency.\n",

    "- Maximum number of nodes allowed in the mini-batch, `max_num_nodes`= 6,\n",

    "![Packing_example_1.png](static/Packing_example_1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Stacking together all of the subgraphs, leads us to having 4 subgraphs in total, which exceeds the `graphs_per_batch` limit.\n",
    "If we batch together subgraphs 0, 1 and 2, this leads us to having 3 graphs, 7 nodes and 6 edges, as such:\n",

    "![Packing_example_2.png](static/Packing_example_2.png)\n",

    "\n",
    "![Packing_example_3.png](static/Packing_example_3.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure we fix the shapes of the tensors to the limits described above, we must add a \"null graph\" with at least 1 node and 1 edge to pad the batch up to the limits without exceeding them. To ensure that this `null graph` doesn't interfere with the other real graphs we attach the padded edges to the padded nodes only (in practice we typically add these padded edges to the final padded node, resulting in many self-loops on the final padded node):\n",
