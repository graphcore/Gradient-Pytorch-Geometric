    "In this tutorial we saw an end to end example of running a GNN on IPUs for a particular task.\n",
    "\n",
    "We built a simple GNN model based on the the `GCNConv` layer provided by the PyTorch Geometric library, trained it with PopTorch and predicted the `Cora` dataset node features.\n",

    "A more in-depth overview of the data handling techniques needed for other types of graph problems can be found in the following links:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you are interested in \"small graph\" problems of the type found in healthcare and chemistry, we recommend you check out the tutorials 3 and 4, `learning-pytorch-geometric-on-ipus/3_small_graph_batching_with_padding.ipynb` and `learning-pytorch-geometric-on-ipus/4_small_graph_batching_with_packing.ipynb`.\n",
    "- If you are looking to apply GNNs to larger graphs, similar to those found in online advertising, shopping and social networks, we recommend you to jump to our Cluster CGN example, found within: `node-prediction/cluster_gcn_training.ipynb` , which showcases how to train it for node classification using sampling.
