    "# Small Graph Batching on IPUs using Padding\n",
    "\n",
    "Batching is an essential procedure to scale the training of a deep learning model to large quantities of data. This process results in the creation of mini-batches of data, where each mini-batch is a collection of samples that can be processed in a single iteration of the training algorithm.\n",
    "The number of samples grouped in a mini-batch is commonly referred to as 'batch size'.\n",
    "\n",
    "Small graph datasets, which are common in molecular science, contain a varying number of nodes and edges per graph. Large graph datasets are often sampled or clustered which results in differently sized graphs.\n",
    "IPUs can only run a statically compiled model - in other words the size of the tensors used are known at compile time. This means that the sizes of our input samples must be  constant over iterations, rather than dynamically sized as most graph datasets are.\n",
    "There are different strategies to obtain fixed size inputs: in this tutorial we will focus on basic approaches suitable to datasets made up of many small graphs. More advanced techniques applicable to such datasets will be discussed in the `learning-pytorch-geometric-on-ipus/4_small_graph_batching_with_packing.ipynb` tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are interested in a large graph use case, have a look at our `node-prediction/cluster_gcn_training.ipynb` example.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you will learn how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- batch small graphs to accelerate training for GNN models,\n",
    "- obtain fixed size input compatible with IPU usage using a fixed size dataloader to batch the input graphs and then pad the resulting mini-batches,\n",
    "- mask out the added padded items in some operations to ensure that the functionality using the fixed size inputs is not adversely affecting the outcome, so we correctly calculate the loss function on the relevant subgraphs,\n",
    "- use PopTorch to transform and prepare our model for distributed training and inference on IPUs.\n",
    "\n",
    "> This tutorial expects you to have familiarity with GNNs, PopTorch, the PyTorch Geometric library and to understand the IPU's requirement for fixed sized tensors. If this is not the case you may want to go through our introductory tutorials `learning-pytorch-geometric-on-ipus/1_at_a_glance.ipynb` and `learning-pytorch-geometric-on-ipus/2_a_worked_example.ipynb`.\n",

    "These limitations can be overcome by using more advanced batching techniques such as packing. To learn more about how to pack graphs on the IPU see our `learning-pytorch-geometric-on-ipus/4_small_graph_batching_with_packing.ipynb` tutorial.\n",

    "In this tutorial, we learnt about the fixed sized batching technique which enables us to quickly get started on training GNNs on the IPU. This was done in the context of the QM9 molecular dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should now have a good understanding of:\n",
    " - how to batch graphs and prepare them for training on the IPU using `FixedSizeDataloader`,\n",
    " - how mini-batches are processed and aggregated within GNN models,\n",
    " - how to handle our padded graphs through masking when we calculate our final loss value, to ensure that the padded graphs are not affecting training.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the next steps take a look at our GNN examples which dive into more specific applications using state of the art models: for instance, take a look at our Schnet Notebook, found within: `graph-prediction/schnet-molecular-property-prediction/schnet_training.ipynb`."
