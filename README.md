# Running PyTorch Geometric Models on an IPU using Paperspace Gradient

GNNs work great with IPUs and PyTorch Geometric makes using GNNs easy. Here you can discover for yourself how to start using PyTorch Geometric with IPUs and get your GNNs training on the IPU in no time. And by using Paperspace to access IPUs you can be up and running in minutes!
